            <div class='introtitle'> HI, I'M LOUISE</div>
            <p> I am currently a 2nd year aspiring user experience designer studying at Michigan State University.
            I am majoring in experience architecture and minoring in graphic design.
            <p></p>
            In my personal life, I love and value making strong connections with people.
            Being able to understand and empathize with people is something very important to me, which is why I am pursuing user experience design and user research.
            Also the teamwork that goes into UX design is, in my opinion, like no other field out there.
            <p></p>
            As a current student, I hope to build on my UX skills and gather experience, whether it be from design projects, case studies, or internships.
