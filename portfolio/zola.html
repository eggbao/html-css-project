    <div class="sectionbold" style="text-align: center;">Project & Objective</div>
    <div class="csbody">This logo design was made for a project that I did for my Intro to Graphic Design class that I took during the summer of 2020 at MSU. For this class project, my objective was to create a logo for a fake brand using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to make a logo related to something that greatly interested me for this project, and that was fishkeeping and aquatics.

        The brainstorm process for this project took a while because I could pick any type of fake brand to design a logo for. It was very hard for me to figure out where to even start until I decided to do a brand that represents something that I am interested in. This got me thinking about my aquarium and aquascaping hobby at home, and I decided to make a logo for a fake brand for an aquatic pet company, utilizing the modern pastel aesthetic that I really liked. The brand I chose was Zola Aquatics.
        <p>Next I sketched up a design for it on paper, making the logo have a modern and welcoming logo that would attract customers and give off the image that Zola Aquatics was a friendly and inviting company. I used pastel colors, differing size circles, and outlines that did not give much contrast to the logo.</p>
        <p>After sketching, I scanned my drawing and went to work using Adobe Illustrator in order to make an outline for my logo and then color it in. I ended up still refining my original sketched outline a bit with the software program.        </p>

    <div class="sectionbold" style="text-align: center;">End Result</div>
    <div class="csbody"> <img src="fish logo.png" class="csbodyimg"><br>The end result was a soft, modern logo for the fake fishkeeping pet store, Zola Aquatics. This logo follows modern design trends and is easy on the eye. Afterwards, I got feedback from my peers and my professor in the class.

    <div class="sectionbold" style="text-align: center;">Reflection</div>
    <div class="csbody">I learned a lot while working on this project, the most significant being that I learned how to take a scan of a drawing, and make it into digital art on Adobe Illustrator. I also basically learned how to use Adobe Illustrator for this project because I had never used the program before. If I were to do this project again, I wouldâ€™ve made the fins and the tail of the fish on the logo more simpler. Now that I have learned about usability, I realized that all the detail on the fins and tail are too distracting and also would not show up well on smaller things such as a business card.</div>
